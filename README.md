- ⚡ Fun fact: house items being "IoTfied" when they should've not be "IoTfied" such as smart toasters, smart toothbrushes and smart microwave will very soon be a nightmare to deal with because of the sheer number of malware being built to infect then and the facility that is to infect a Iot with built-in factory settings, DDoS will be way more common and brute force attacks will not just be way moore common but also more difficult to deal with, because doesn't matter if you have a password that takes a million years to decode when you have 100 thousands mini computers that can decode it in a month or less
